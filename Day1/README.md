# Day 1 — Exercises

This folder contains Day 1 starter exercises and examples.

## Contents
- `HelloWorld.java` — simple program that prints a greeting.
- `Sum.java` — simple program that prints the sum of two numbers.

## How to compile and run

From the repository root run:

```bash
javac -d out Day1/src/HelloWorld.java Day1/src/Sum.java
java -cp out HelloWorld
# or
java -cp out Sum
```

## Notes
- These examples are intentionally minimal so you can expand them for practice.
- If you use an IDE such as IntelliJ, open the `Day1` folder as a module/project.
